Although most devices in an IoT network are directly connected, via access points, to the\\nInternet; there is an inherent flexibility in devices to connect to other wireless devices in their communication range in order to leverage\\ntheir capabilities resulting in powerful functionalities. Furthermore, some commercially available devices have extremely versatile\\nprocessing and communication capabilities, e.g., the Amazon Echo [2], Google Home [3], etc., which enables them to execute custom\\nprograms and processes.\",\n","        \"IoT devices are manufactured by different vendors without strong regulations on embedding cyber security features in the software.\\nTo reduce cost and time-to-market, security issues may be overlooked by device manufacturers [4]. In addition to inherent\\nsoftware vulnerabilities, several other factors increase the risk of cyber attacks on these devices. One of the risks is the\\nuse of stock passwords to access the control panel of these devices. Moreover, most IoT devices are left to operate\\non consumer premises without regular maintenance. It exposes them to the risk of being infected and controlled by\\nmalicious software processes, referred to as malware [5]. It is also possible that consumers might willingly accept to\\ninstall certain processes or applications on their devices in return for financial incentives, completely unaware of the\\nfact  that  they  might  be  used  to  launch  a  distributed  denial  of  service  (DDoS)  attack [6]  on  the  network  at  a  later\\nstage.\",\n","        \"Botnets have become a significant threat to computer and communication networks in the last decade [7]. A botnet is a network of\\ndevices infected by malicious software and controlled by an external operator referred to as the botmaster [8]. Often, the malware\\ninfiltrates the network stealthily over time in a self-replicating manner before being instructed by the botmaster to trigger\\nan attack. The objective of the botnet is to cause disruption in service provisioning leading to loss of operation and\\nsometimes  with  the  intent  of  obtaining  ransom [9].  The  most  famous  botnet  attack  in  recent  history  has  been  the\\nMirai in 2016 [10]. Recently, researchers have identified variants of the Mirai botnet referred to as the IoTroop or\\nReaper  that  is  aimed  at  using  IoT  devices  to  launch  DDoS  attacks [11].

Due to the absence of centralized connectivity, the botmaster is compelled to use the same D2D links to\\nissue control commands for coordinating an attack. Seed viruses may be planted into the networks using malicious or infected\\nIoT devices or even using UAVs [13]. Moreover, the botmster may change the malware code dynamically and may\\nissue control commands to launch a wireless denial of service (WDoS) attack [14]. It is different from traditional\\nDDoS attacks as services do not have to be taken off the Internet. Instead, the goal is to exploit MAC vulnerabilities in\\nwireless devices to generate superfluous traffic that sabotages legitimate operation [15]. The D2D nature of the wireless\\ncommunication network makes it harder to launch a coordinated DDoS. However, at the same time, it is also hard to defend\\nagainst it as a network of devices contributes to the attack and there is no single source.

This is extremely important since otherwise, the solution to the optimization problem may be\\ndifficult as one of the constraints saturates and is no longer monotonously increasing or decreasing. However, evaluating the condition a\\npriori, we can circumvent this difficulty and effectively solve the optimization problem. However, there are several additional\\nchallenges. First, since the network is random, there is no upper bound on the maximum possible degree of a device, which makes the\\noptimization problem intractable due to an infinite number of optimization variables. However, due to the structure of the\\nnetwork10 ,\\nit is increasingly rare for a device to have larger degrees. Therefore, we note that there exists a sufficiently large k = kmax such that\\nℙ[K > kmax] ≤ 𝜖, where 𝜖 is arbitrarily small. This allows us to convert the optimization problem into one with finite\\nnumber of optimization variables referred to as μ = [μ1,μ2,…,μkmax]T.

Hence, effectively, these terms can be removed and the problem can be converted\\ninto a finite optimization problem. Since the primal problem may be non-convex, we resort to solving the dual optimization\\nproblem [40]. Note, however, that the duality gap in this problem setting is zero and hence solving the dual problem is equivalent to\\nsolving the primal problem (See Appendix E for details).

Simulation & Validation\",\n","        \"In this section, we conduct simulation experiments to validate the accuracy of the obtained theoretical results. In the first\\npart, we simulate the considered PPP network. Two different phases are investigated. In the first phase, a malware\\nis introduced at epoch to an arbitrarily selected node and is allowed to propagate to its neighbourhood according to\\nthe device vulnerabilities, wireless transmission success probability, as well as the malware propagation rates. The\\nmalware  spreads  from  one  device  to  another  in  a  D2D  fashion  until  all  the  network  has  been  compromised.  Note\\nthat during the initial phase, there is no patching of devices. During the second phase, the optimal patching policy\\nfor  each  device,  based  on  its  degree,  is  applied  on  the  network.  This  leads  to  the  recovery  of  bot  devices  and  the\\nproportions of bots in the network is observed over time. The experiment is repeated for different target thresholds\\nfor bot-free population, i.e., τB = 0.7,0.8 and 0.9. Fig. 7 illustrates a snapshot of the device states in the network\\nafter reaching equilibrium. Note that more devices are un-compromised at equilibrium as τB increases as reflected by\\nFig. 7a, 7b, and 7c. The time evolution of un-compromised devices for each of the thresholds is recorded in Fig. 8.\\nNotice that the proportion of un-compromised devices increasingly drops from 100% to 0% as the malware is allowed\\nto propagate in the network. However, when the patching process is started in the second phase (i.e., t = 104), the\\nbot-free population sharply rises until it reaches the target threshold. Although the population keeps fluctuating due\\nto the ongoing dynamical processes but on average the policy is observed to accurately achieve the defined targets.\\n  To further illustrate the usefulness and impact of our proposed methodology and obtained results, we simulate an experiment on\\nthe actual LinkNYC hotspot locations data. We assume that IoT devices are placed at each of these locations with a\\ncommunication range of 140 m. Again, the simulation is carried out in two phases. In the first phase, the malware is allowed to\\npropagate in the network until it has achieved the maximum spread. To ensure complete penetration of the malware in the\\nnetwork, we initially introduce the malware in nodes which have a degree of 2. This allows the propagation of the\\nmalware from one device to another over time until it affects most of the nodes during the first phase. Note that this\\nnetwork is not exactly a PPP, the malware spread is not as effective since some nodes may be isolated or clustered\\ntogether. Similarly, during the second phase (i.e., t = 2.5 × 104), the patching process is started until the equilibrium is\\nachieved. Again, the experiment is repeated for different target thresholds for bot-free population, i.e., τB = 0.7,0.8\\nand 0.9. The snapshots of the network states at equilibrium are shown in Fig. 9. A similar behaviour is observed as\\nthe network increasingly becomes bot free at equilibrium as the patching rates are increased. The time evolution of\\nun-compromised devices for each of the thresholds is recorded in Fig. 10. We start off with infecting around 40% of\\nthe devices with malware and allow it to spread. It results in an infection of around 92% of the network with 8%\\nun-compromised devices. However, once the patching policy is implemented, the network recovers sharply and is able to\\nachieve much higher bot-free proportions than the target. It is pertinent to mention that since the network is not a\\nPPP, the spread of malware is more difficult. Hence, the developed patching policy is more effective than expected,\\nresulting in better performance of the policy. Therefore, a Poisson network assumption proves to be a more conservative\\napproximation of the real network, which is favourable in practice as the results correspond to a worst case scenario.\",\n","        \"VI.

Thus, possible use cases of these tag-based recommender systems include the suggestion of resources to extend a user\\u2019s set of bookmarks [4,\\u00a038] and the suggestion of tags to assist in the annotation of these bookmarks. The latter one is known as the field of tag recommendations 13.\",\n","        \"Over the past years, various recommendation frameworks and libraries have been developed in order to support the development and evaluation of recommender systems (see Section 4). While these frameworks cover a wide range of application domains, to the best of our knowledge, an open-source recommendation framework to design and evaluate tag-based recommender systems was still lacking. Therefore, in 2014, we have started developing TagRec, a standardized tag recommender benchmarking framework 19. In the initial development phase of the framework, we mainly focused on evaluating tag recommendation algorithms. In 2015, the framework was extended by including resource recommendation algorithms that are based on social tagging data 36.\",\n","        \"The aim of this paper, however, is to present the current, updated state of TagRec. This includes the extension of the framework for (i) the analysis of tag reuse practices 21, (ii) the evaluation of tag recommendations in real-world folksonomy and Technology Enhanced Learning settings [16,\\u00a020], and (iii) hashtag recommendations in Twitter 22.\",\n","        \"Apart from that, we provide an updated framework description (see Section 2) as well as a summary of use cases in the field of recommender research that have been completed using TagRec (see Section 3). Research areas encompass tag recommendations, resource recommendations, recommendation evaluation and hashtag recommendations. To date, TagRec has served the recommender development and/or evaluation processes in two large-scale European research projects, which have been published in 17 research papers. We conclude the paper with a discussion on future work and potential improvements of the framework (see Section 5).\",\n","        \"We believe that our work contributes to the rich portfolio of technical frameworks in the area of recommender systems. Furthermore, this paper presents an overview of use cases which can be realized with TagRec, and should be of interest for both researchers and developers of tag-based recommender systems.\",\n","        \"TagRec is a Java-based recommendation framework for tag-based information retrieval settings. It is open-source software and freely available via our Github repository1 . The Github page also contains a detailed technical description on the usage of the framework.\",\n","        \"Figure 1 illustrates TagRec\\u2019s system architecture. The framework consists of (i) a data processing component, which processes data sources, (ii) a data model and analytics component, which enables access to the processed data, (iii) recommendation algorithms, which calculate recommendations, (iv) an evaluation engine, which evaluates the algorithms, and (v) recommendation results, which can be passed to a client application. The mentioned components are described in more detail in the remainder of this section. Apart from that, we describe practical aspects of the framework that should be helpful when implementing and/or evaluating a recommendation algorithm. Finally, Table 1 provides an overview of the supported datasets, recommendation algorithms and evaluation metrics.\",\n","        \"Data Processing. The data processing component is responsible for parsing and processing external data sources. Currently supported datasets are listed in Table 1. These datasets serve a wide range of application domains such as social bookmarking systems, learning environments, microblogging tools and music/movie sharing portals. The set of datasets can easily be extended by implementing custom data pre-processing strategies.\",\n","        \"Furthermore, this component supports various data enrichment and transformation methods such as p-core pruning 8, topic modeling 25, training/test set splitting 20 and data conversion into related formats (eg, for MyMediaLite 9).\",\n","        \"Data Model and Analytics. The data model is created based on described data processing steps and provides an object-oriented representation of the data in order to ease the implementation process of a novel recommendation algorithm. Thus, it enables easy access to the entities in the datasets via powerful query functionality (eg, get the set of tags a user has used in the past). Furthermore, the data model of TagRec is connected to Apache Solr2 and thus, enables fast access to content-based data of entities.\",\n","        \"Another role of this component is the provision of basic data analytics functionality to get a better understanding of the dataset characteristics. For example, dataset statistics, such as the total number of distinct tags or the average number of bookmarks per user, can be retrieved.\",\n","        \"Recommendation Algorithms. TagRec contains a wide range of recommendation algorithms (see Table 1). As later described in Section 3, algorithms for tag recommendations, resource recommendations and hashtag recommendations are provided. These algorithms can be used as baseline approaches for a newly implemented algorithm. The complete list of all variants of these algorithms is provided on the TagRec\\u2019s Github page.\",\n","        \"A key contributions of TagRec is that next to well-established approaches, such as Collaborative Filtering, MostPopular and Factorization machines, it also encompasses approaches based upon cognitive models of information retrieval, human memory theory and category learning. In 20, it has been shown that these cognitive-inspired approaches achieve high prediction accuracy estimates in comparison to classic recommendation algorithms. Besides, the algorithms have demonstrated their suitability for sparse datasets such and narrow folksonomies.\",\n","        \"Evaluation Engine. The evaluation engine quantifies the quality of implemented recommendation strategies by applying a rich set of evaluation metrics as listed in Table 1. One drawback of most recommendation evaluation frameworks is their focus on accuracy and ranking estimates, which restricts the evaluation to the performance of recommender systems 2.\",\n","        \"To fill this gap, TagRec supports a variety of evaluation metrics to also offer indicators for diversity, novelty, runtime performance and memory consumption of algorithms. For evaluating an algorithm, TagRec has to be provided with three parameters, where the first one specifies the algorithm, the second one specifies the dataset directory and the third one specifies the file name of the dataset sample. For example, java jar tagrec.jar cf bib bib_sample runs Collaborative Filtering on a sample of the BibSonomy dataset. The calculated metrics are then either written to a \\u201cmetrics\\u201d file or printed to the console.\",\n","        \"Recommendation Results. As indicated in Figure 1, the algorithms\\u2019 recommendation results can be either forwarded to the evaluation engine to retrieve evaluation metrics or to a client application for further processing (eg, visualization). The KnowBrain tool 7 is an example of such a client application. It is an open source social bookmarking tool, which has been extended to cater the requirements of tag recommender evaluations in online settings.\",\n","        \"A screenshot of KnowBrain\\u2019s graphical user interface is shown in Figure 2. It enables the bookmarking of Web links and their annotations by (i) selecting from a pre-defined set of categories, and by (ii) assigning a variable number of tags. The user\\u2019s tagging process is supported by a list of recommended tags that are selected based on algorithms of the TagRec framework. The elicitation of categories allows for semantic context-based recommendation algorithms such as 3Layers 35. Furthermore, the comparison of actually used tags with recommended tags gives insights into the online performance (ie, user acceptance) of recommendation strategies.\",\n","        \"In this section, we describe use cases that have been implemented using the TagRec framework. To date, TagRec supported the recommender development and/or evaluation processes in two large-scale European research projects. Results have been published in 17 research papers (see Table 2).\",\n","        \"Tag recommendation systems assist users in finding descriptive tags to annotate resources. In other words, given a specific user and a specific resource, a tag recommendation algorithm predicts a set of tags a user is likely to apply in annotating the resource 13.\",\n","        \"Within this context, TagRec was used for the creation of (i) cognitive-inspired algorithms, and (ii) the evaluation of approaches suitable for formal and informal learning settings.\",\n","        \"Tag Recommendations Using a Model of Human Categorization. In [17,\\u00a023,\\u00a035], the authors introduced a tag recommendation algorithm based on the human categorization models ALCOVE 26 and MINERVA2 12. This algorithm is called 3Layers and simulates categorization processes in human memory. Therefore, the categories assigned to a given resource, which a user is going to annotate, are matched against already annotated resources of this user. Based on this matchmaking process, a set of tags associated with semantically related resources is recommended.\",\n","        \"Since TagRec enables to link a list of categories to a resource, it supported the development of 3Layers by providing functions for analyzing and deriving category information of resources (eg, via LDA topic modeling 25).\",\n","        \"Utilizing Activation Processes in Human Memory. Activation processes in human memory describe the general and context-dependent usefulness of information. It was shown that these processes (especially usage frequency, recency and semantic context) greatly influence the reuse probability of tags 21. Based on this, a set of time-aware tag recommendation approaches (see [18,\\u00a024,\\u00a037]) was developed that utilize the activation equation of the cognitive architecture ACT-R 1.\",\n","        \"Therefore, TagRec was used to analyze the timestamps of tag assignments and to calculate tag co-occurrences for reflecting the semantic context of social tagging. Furthermore, TagRec enabled the hybrid combination of the components of the model (eg, combining time-aware and context-aware recommendations).\",\n","        \"Tag Recommendations in Informal Learning Settings. In the course of the European-funded project Learning Layers3 , which aims at supporting informal learning at the workplace, tag recommendations were used to support the individual user in finding descriptive tags and the collective in consolidating a shared tag vocabulary. These tag recommendations were used in two tools: (i) the Dropbox-like environment KnowBrain 7, and (ii) the Sensemaking interface Bits & Pieces 6.\",\n","        \"To achieve this, TagRec was integrated as a tag recommendation library into the Social Semantic Server 5, which was used as the technical back-end for KnowBrain and Bits & Pieces. This shows that TagRec cannot only be used as a standalone tool but also as a programming library (or toolkit) to include recommendation functionality in existing software. A similar approach will be followed in another European-funded project called AFEL4 , which engages in design and development of analytics for everyday learning.\",\n","        \"Resource recommender systems suggest potentially relevant web items (eg, movies, books, learning resources, URLs, etc.) to users. Most of these recommender systems are based on Collaborative Filtering (CF) techniques, which aim to calculate similarities between users to suggest the most suitable web resources to them 33. TagRec was applied to support and improve the development of CF approaches in tag-based online environments.\",\n","        \"Mimicking Attention-Interpretation Dynamics. Seitlinger et al. 34 introduced the first version of a CF-based recommendation approach that takes into consideration non-linear user-artifact dynamics, modeled by means of SUSTAIN. SUSTAIN (Supervised and Unsupervised STratified Adaptive Incremental Network) is a flexible network model of human category learning that is thoroughly discussed in 29. It assumes that learning is a dynamic process that takes place through the encounter of new examples (eg, Web resources). Throughout the learning trajectory, categories emerge and learners\\u2019 attention foci shift. In 15, an advanced, adapted version of the initial approach was presented and analyzed in detail. The resulting approach SUSTAIN CF, firstly applies CF to calculate the most suitable resources for a user, and secondly re-ranks this list depending on a user\\u2019s category learning model (ie, SUSTAIN\\u2019s user model).\",\n","        \"The algorithm has been implemented and developed within the TagRec framework. Features of the framework allowed for continuous evaluation and analysis of single factors of the model and with it, the associated change of recommendation performance. With this data, it was possible to gain deeper insight into the algorithmic approach and its parameters and thus, to further adapt the model to the requirements of our application area.\",\n","        \"Resource Recommendations using Tag and Time Information. In 27, the Collaborative Item Ranking Using Tag and Time Information (CIRTT) approach was presented. CIRTT uses Collaborative Filtering to identify a set of candidate resources and re-ranks these candidate resources by incorporating tag and time information. This is achieved via the Base-Level-Learning (BLL) equation, which is one component of ACT-R\\u2019s activation equation 1.\",\n","        \"Since TagRec contains a full implementation of the activation equation, it could be easily adapted for the task of resource recommendations as well. Apart from that, TagRec was used to compare CIRTTT to other related resource recommendation methods (eg, 40). Another study of the recency effects in Collaborative Filtering recommender systems was provided in 28.\",\n","        \"One of the most challenging tasks in the area of recommender systems, is the reproducible evaluation of recommendation results 11. TagRec aims to support this process by providing standardized data processing methods, baseline algorithm implementations, evaluation protocols and metrics.\",\n","        \"Evaluating Tag Recommendations in Real-World Folksonomies. Because of the sparse nature of social tagging systems, most tag recommendation evaluation studies were conducted using p-core pruned datasets. This means that all users, resources and tags, which do not appear at least p times in the dataset, are removed. This clearly does not reflect a real-world folksonomy setting as shown by 8.\",\n","        \"To overcome this problem, TagRec was used in 20 to compare a rich set of tag recommendation algorithms using a wide range of evaluation metrics on six unfiltered social tagging datasets (ie, Flickr, CiteULike, BibSonomy, Delicious, LastFM and MovieLens). The results showed that the efficacy of a recommendation algorithm greatly depends on the given dataset characteristics, and that cognitive-inspired approaches provide the most robust results, even in sparse data folksonomy settings.\",\n","        \"Comparing Recommendation Algorithms in Technology Enhanced Learning Settings. Kopeinik et al. 16 is another example of using TagRec for the evaluation of a variety of algorithms on different offline datasets. The paper focused on technology-enhanced formal and informal learning environments, where due to fast changing domains and characteristic group learning settings, data is typically sparse. The evaluation was divided in two settings, the performance of (i) resource recommendation strategies, and (ii) tag recommendation strategies. In both cases, the authors compared the recommendation accuracy of a number of computationally-inexpensive recommendation algorithms on six offline datasets retrieved from various educational settings (ie, social bookmarking systems, social learning environments and massive open online courses). Investigated approaches are either state-of-the-art recommendation approaches, or strategies that have been explicitly suggested in the context of TEL systems.\",\n","        \"To address the goals of this study, the TagRec framework already provided a wide range of required functionality such as the implemented data processing component, evaluation metrics and state-of-the-art algorithms. In the context of this research paper, it was further extended by a couple of algorithms that are considered particularly relevant to learning settings and by additional statistics, which were needed to interpret evaluation results properly.\",\n","        \"Over the past years, hashtags have become very popular in systems such as Twitter, Instagram and Facebook. Similar to social tags, hashtags are freely-chosen keywords to categorize resources such as Twitter posts (ie, tweets). One of the biggest advantages of hashtags is that they can be easily used by integrating them in the tweet text. Unsurprisingly, this has led to the development of hashtag recommendation algorithms that aim to support users in applying the most descriptive hashtags to their tweets 39.\",\n","        \"Temporal Effects on Hashtag Reuse. In 22, a time-dependent and cognitive-inspired hashtag recommendation approach was proposed. In this paper, temporal effects on hashtag reuse in Twitter have been analyzed with the help of TagRec in order to design a hashtag recommendation approach, which utilizes the BLL equation of the cognitive architecture ACT-R 1. Therefore, TagRec was extended with functions to access Apache Solr (see Section 2), which enables the content-based analysis of tweets using TF-IDF (see 22).\",\n","        \"In recent years, a multitude of recommendation engines have been created and made available either for commercial use or as open-source systems. In 14, a well-structured overview of such approaches is presented. The author differentiates between Software-as-a-Service (ie, SaaS), non-SaaS, open-source, academic and benchmarking recommender systems. We consider open-source and benchmarking frameworks that implement recommendation strategies fitting academic purposes as most relevant to our work.\",\n","        \"A considerable contribution to this area is LibRec5 , a Java-based library that, so far, comprises around 70 resource recommendation algorithms and evaluation modules 10. Another Java-based, open-source framework is RankSys6 , which focuses on the evaluation of ranking problems and supports the investigation of novelty as well as diversity for academic research 3, which is reflected in its design (eg, data input interfaces work with a triple of user, item and features).\",\n","        \"Other examples of open-source recommender software are MyMediaLite7 , an item recommender library that focuses on rating and ranking predictions in collaborative filtering approaches 9, CARSKit8 , a recommendation library specifically designed for context-aware recommendations, and Tag Recommender9 , a software component that implements Tensor Factorization models for personalized tag recommendations in C++ 31.\",\n","        \"However, to the best of our knowledge, an open-source recommender framework that implements a wide range of tag and resource recommendation algorithms (including a number of cognitive-inspired approaches) for the design and evaluation of personalized tag-based recommendation strategies was still missing.\",\n","        \"In this paper, we presented the TagRec framework as a toolkit for the development and evaluation of tag-based recommender systems.

vicinity. The communication flexibility coupled with software vulnerabilities in devices, due to low cost and short time-to-market, exposes them to a high risk of malware infiltration. Malware may infect a large number of network devices using device-to-device (D2D) communication resulting in the formation of a botnet, ie, a network of infected devices controlled by a common malware. A botmaster may exploit it to launch a network-wide attack sabotaging infrastructure and facilities, or for malicious purposes such as collecting ransom. In this paper, we propose an analytical model to study the D2D propagation of malware in wireless IoT networks. Leveraging tools from dynamic population processes and point process theory, we capture malware infiltration and coordination process over a network topology. The analysis of mean-field equilibrium in the population is used to construct and solve an optimization problem for the network defender to prevent botnet formation by patching devices while causing minimum overhead to network operation. The developed analytical model serves as a basis for assisting the planning, design, and defense of such networks from a defender\\u2019s standpoint.\",\n","        \"Index Terms Botnet, Internet of Things, device-to-device communication, population processes, distributed denial of service.\",\n","        \"The Internet of things (IoT) comprises of a network of sensors and actuators, which are embedded computers, communicating with each other and to the Internet. Often, the endpoint devices rely on a plethora of wireless communication technologies and protocols such as WiFi, Bluetooth, Zigbee, etc.,\\u00a01. Although most devices in an IoT network are directly connected, via access points, to the Internet; there is an inherent flexibility in devices to connect to other wireless devices in their communication range in order to leverage their capabilities resulting in powerful functionalities. Furthermore, some commercially available devices have extremely versatile processing and communication capabilities, eg, the Amazon Echo\\u00a02, Google Home\\u00a03, etc., which enables them to execute custom programs and processes.\",\n","        \"IoT devices are manufactured by different vendors without strong regulations on embedding cyber security features in the software. To reduce cost and time-to-market, security issues may be overlooked by device manufacturers\\u00a04. In addition to inherent software vulnerabilities, several other factors increase the risk of cyber attacks on these devices. One of the risks is the use of stock passwords to access the control panel of these devices. Moreover, most IoT devices are left to operate on consumer premises without regular maintenance. It exposes them to the risk of being infected and controlled by malicious software processes, referred to as malware\\u00a05. It is also possible that consumers might willingly accept to install certain processes or applications on their devices in return for financial incentives, completely unaware of the fact that they might be used to launch a distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack\\u00a06 on the network at a later stage.\",\n","        \"Botnets have become a significant threat to computer and communication networks in the last decade\\u00a07. A botnet is a network of devices infected by malicious software and controlled by an external operator referred to as the botmaster\\u00a08. Often, the malware infiltrates the network stealthily over time in a self-replicating manner before being instructed by the botmaster to trigger an attack. The objective of the botnet is to cause disruption in service provisioning leading to loss of operation and sometimes with the intent of obtaining ransom\\u00a09. The most famous botnet attack in recent history has been the Mirai in 2016\\u00a010. Recently, researchers have identified variants of the Mirai botnet referred to as the IoTroop or Reaper that is aimed at using IoT devices to launch DDoS attacks\\u00a011. It is a powerful botnet that comprises of compromised domestic wireless routers, TVs, DVRs, and surveillance cameras exploiting vulnerabilities in devices from major manufacturers.\",\n","        \"In the case of wireless IoT networks, the malware may spread from one device to another among devices that are in close geographical proximity\\u00a012. Due to the absence of centralized connectivity, the botmaster is compelled to use the same D2D links to issue control commands for coordinating an attack. Seed viruses may be planted into the networks using malicious or infected IoT devices or even using UAVs\\u00a013. Moreover, the botmster may change the malware code dynamically and may issue control commands to launch a wireless denial of service (WDoS) attack\\u00a014. It is different from traditional DDoS attacks as services do not have to be taken off the Internet. Instead, the goal is to exploit MAC vulnerabilities in wireless devices to generate superfluous traffic that sabotages legitimate operation\\u00a015. The D2D nature of the wireless communication network makes it harder to launch a coordinated DDoS. However, at the same time, it is also hard to defend against it as a network of devices contributes to the attack and there is no single source. Therefore, the best strategy for a network defender is to prevent the dynamic development of a large scale botnet and limit its ability to launch a DDoS.\",\n","        \"Several dynamic processes might be burgeoning in the network at the same time. Malware in an infected device might be attempting to replicate itself in nearby devices. Furthermore, the infected devices also share control commands with other infected devices to agree on an attack point. On the other hand, the network defense mechanisms are also in place which periodically patch1 the devices. The patching frequency of devices needs to be carefully selected as it negatively affects the regular device operation. Particularly, if a device acts as a hub, ie, connecting multiple devices together, the impact of downtime will be much more severe. In order to make such optimal patching frequency decisions, we need a theoretical model that can accurately capture the connectivity characteristics of the network and incorporate the continuing dynamic processes.\",\n","        \"While the modeling and analysis of traditional Internet based botnets is also important due to its huge monetary and non-monetary impact, there have been some efforts to prevent and control them. However, the botnets in wireless IoT systems need special attention due to the current lack of awareness and the increased security vulnerability of IoT devices. Despite the impending security threat to a massive number of unprotected IoT devices and systems, there is a severe dearth of systematic methodologies for understanding such systems from a security standpoint. This necessitates the development of exclusive models for such wireless IoT networks which can capture the spatial distribution of the devices and the dynamic processes of malware infiltration, control command propagation, and device patching by the defender.

Furthermore, the existing studies are are either based on simulations\\u00a0[19,\\u00a020] or use abstract theoretical models that do not capture the dynamics of malware propagation or the network geometry into account\\u00a021.

While these are trying to mitigate the risks of a large scale DDoS by a botnet, they do not not account for the dynamics of the malware propagation or the network geometry aspects that are important in wireless IoT networks. On the other hand, a framework for preventing malware propagation in wireless sensor networks has been proposed in\\u00a025 that captures the network features, however, it does not take into account the stealthy propagation behavior of a botnet which requires information dissemination and coordination to launch an attack. To overcome the challenge of understanding the propagation of information in wireless networks, we have proposed a framework in our previous works\\u00a0[26,\\u00a027], leveraging concepts from mathematical epidemiology\\u00a028 and point process theory. However, traditional epidemiological models such as\\u00a029 and\\u00a030 are not sufficient to analyze the botnet formation in wireless networks due to the interplay between malware infection, control commands propagation, and device patching. In this paper, we develop novel methodologies to overcome the unique challenges of modeling and analyzing the crucial interplay between malware infection, control commands propagation, and device patching in wireless IoT networks. We leverage ideas from the theories of dynamic population processes\\u00a031 and point processes to setup a mean field dynamical system that captures the evolution of malware infected devices and control command aware devices over time. In general, obtaining tractable characterizations of the equilibrium state in such population processes is theoretically involved due to the self-consistent nature of the equations involved and the complex connectivity profile of the network.

Furthermore, devices that are bots may or may not have received control commands. Those that have received control commands may have discarded them due being stale or outdated. Note that since the devices may go from one state to the other based on their communication interactions within their neighborhood, it is appropriate to categorize the devices according to their connectivity or degree6 . This allows us to use the degree based mean field approach to study the spread of malware and their communication\\u00a038. The possible system states of the population of degree k devices, ie, devices that are capable of communicating with k other devices, can then be classified as follows:\",\n","        \"Once, the states are defined, we can study the transitions between each of these states.

Similarly, an un-informed bot may become an informed bot at a rate that is proportional to its degree k and the average probability that it is connected to an informed bot, denoted by \\u03c32. On the other hand, an informed bot may discard the control commands at a constant rate \\u03b2 to return to an un-informed state to maintain recency of control information. Finally, if the bots are patched, they return to an un-compromised state. We use a degree based patching rate \\u03bck inspired from the non-uniform transmission model proposed in\\u00a039. This completes all the transitions between the possible system states.\",\n","        \"B State Space Representation & Dynamics\",\n","        \"In this subsection, we formally express the dynamics of the system using the developed state space. The state space representation and associated transitions described in the previous subsection are illustrated by the state diagram shown in Figure\\u00a03. Using the figure and leveraging concepts from the theory of population processes\\u00a031, the state evolution can be mathematically described by the following dynamical system of equations:\",\n","        \"Note that\\u00a0(1) captures the birth and death processes of un-compromised devices. In other words, it implies that at time t, the population proportion of un-compromised degree k devices is increasing with a rate that is proportional to the patching rate and the population proportion of bot devices. However, at the same time, it is also decreasing at a rate that is proportional to the degree k and the expected rate of interacting with a bot device. Similarly, we can interpret the remaining dynamical equations for un-informed bot and informed bot populations. Since, the states represent the population proportions, we can use the closure relationship, ie, Bk(t) + B\\u0128k(t) + BIk(t) = 1,\\u2200t \\u2265 0, to reduce eqs.\\u00a0(1) to\\u00a0(3) to the following independent dynamical system of equations:\",\n","        \"Note that the average probability for a degree k device to be connected to a bot device, \\u03c31 is directly proportional to the probability of transmission success, the vulnerability of the devices, the malware spreading rate, and the probability of being connected to a bot device.

Similarly, an auxiliary result emanating from\\u00a0(13) is expressed in the following Corollary.\",\n","        \"Although the results presented in Lemma\\u00a01 are useful, however, the presence of the minimum and maximum functions present a challenge in leveraging them for optimization purposes.

It results in the following:\",\n","        \"Finally, using the results of Lemma\\u00a01 and the subsequent LSE relaxation, the equilibrium populations of devices that are un-compromised and devices that are informed bots is expressed by the following theorem:\",\n","        \"In the following subsection, we make use of the developed analytical model and the approximate results to formulate the network defense problem and subsequently discuss the methodology for solving it.\",\n","        \"D Network Defense Problem & Solution\",\n","        \"The goal of the network defender is to set up a patching schedule for each network device based on its connectivity in order to prevent the formation of a large scale botnet. The patching rate must take into account the disruption caused to regular operation due to the strategies employed, eg, firmware upgrade or power cycling, which can be in terms of the downtime of devices. The cost incurred on the operation of a network device due to patching activity is assumed to be a smooth, convex, and increasing function of the patching rate \\u03bck, represented by \\u03d5k : \\u211d+ \\u2192\\u211d+,\\u2200k \\u2265 1. The risk of a botnet formation can be measured in terms of the equilibrium population of devices that are bots and the devices that are receiving control commands assuming knowledge of the transmission rates. Accordingly, targets for the minimum expected proportion of network that is un-compromised and the maximum tolerable proportion of the network that is an informed bot, denoted by \\u03c4B \\u2208 [0,1] and \\u03c4BI \\u2208 [0,1] respectively, can be set. The network defender\\u2019s problem can then be formulated as follows:\",\n","        \"The objective represents the total expected cost of patching devices at a rate \\u03bck,\\u2200k, while the constraints imply that the average proportion of un-compromised devices in the network must be higher than \\u03c4B and the average proportion of informed bot devices in the network must be smaller than \\u03c4BI. Note that the constraints are coupled with the objective, which makes the primal problem challenging to solve. Furthermore, despite the fact that the objective is convex, both the constraints may be non-convex in the decision vector since some terms inside the summation are concave while others are convex. This is formally stated in the following lemma.\",\n","        \"Another important observation is that the constraints are linked in terms of the patching rates. A set of patching rates may completely satisfy one of the constraints but not the other. Therefore, it is important to investigate the conditions under which the constraints are active, particularly because there exists a limiting rate at which the constraints saturate. The following lemma presents an important condition relating the target thresholds that determines the status of the constraints.\",\n","        \"Therefore, if the condition presented in Lemma\\u00a03 is satisfied, we can effectively ignore the constraint\\u00a0(22) from the optimization problem and proceed with only\\u00a0(21). This is extremely important since otherwise, the solution to the optimization problem may be difficult as one of the constraints saturates and is no longer monotonously increasing or decreasing. However, evaluating the condition a priori, we can circumvent this difficulty and effectively solve the optimization problem. However, there are several additional challenges. First, since the network is random, there is no upper bound on the maximum possible degree of a device, which makes the optimization problem intractable due to an infinite number of optimization variables. However, due to the structure of the network10 , it is increasingly rare for a device to have larger degrees. Therefore, we note that there exists a sufficiently large k = kmax such that \\u2119[K > kmax] \\u2264 \\ud835\\udf16, where \\ud835\\udf16 is arbitrarily small. This allows us to convert the optimization problem into one with finite number of optimization variables referred to as \\u03bc = [\\u03bc1,\\u03bc2,\\u2026,\\u03bckmax]T Therefore, the problem can then be expressed as follows:\",\n","        \"Since, the the Poisson density decays faster than the exponential rate for large degree values, the terms labeled as \\ud835\\udf161,\\ud835\\udf162, and \\ud835\\udf163 can be made arbitrarily small for sufficiently large kmax. Hence, effectively, these terms can be removed and the problem can be converted into a finite optimization problem. Since the primal problem may be non-convex, we resort to solving the dual optimization problem\\u00a040. Note, however, that the duality gap in this problem setting is zero and hence solving the dual problem is equivalent to solving the primal problem (See Appendix\\u00a0E for details). We, therefore, relax the original problem by forming the Lagrangian as follows:\",\n","        \"Note that due to the structure of the Lagrangian, the optimization problem in the dual function decouples in the optimization variables, which makes the complexity of evaluating g(\\u03b6,\\u03be) linear in kmax\\u00a041. For a given pair of Lagrange multipliers, the optimal patching rates \\u03bc\\u2217 can be written as follows:\",\n","        \"Note that if both Bk\\u2217 and BIk\\u2217 are not monotonous in \\u03bck, it may not be possible to obtain a globally optimal solution for \\u03bck in\\u00a0(26).

However, the expected total patching cost increases at a decreasing rate with increasing control command propagation rate. This shows that the defender is more reactive to the malware spreading rate than the control command propagation rate in terms of a botnet formation. With regards to the effect of varying the device vulnerability in the network as well as the probability of transmission success, a similar behaviour is observed since changing these parameters in turn alters the effective malware propagation rate and the control command propagation rate.\",\n","        \"A Simulation & Validation\",\n","        \"In this section, we conduct simulation experiments to validate the accuracy of the obtained theoretical results. In the first part, we simulate the considered PPP network. Two different phases are investigated. In the first phase, a malware is introduced at epoch to an arbitrarily selected node and is allowed to propagate to its neighbourhood according to the device vulnerabilities, wireless transmission success probability, as well as the malware propagation rates. The malware spreads from one device to another in a D2D fashion until all the network has been compromised. Note that during the initial phase, there is no patching of devices. During the second phase, the optimal patching policy for each device, based on its degree, is applied on the network. This leads to the recovery of bot devices and the proportions of bots in the network is observed over time. The experiment is repeated for different target thresholds for bot-free population, ie, \\u03c4B = \\u0001\\u0002,\\u0001\\u0002 and \\u0001\\u0002. Figure\\u00a07 illustrates a snapshot of the device states in the network after reaching equilibrium. Note that more devices are un-compromised at equilibrium as \\u03c4B increases as reflected by Figure\\u00a07a,\\u00a07b, and\\u00a07c. The time evolution of un-compromised devices for each of the thresholds is recorded in Figure\\u00a08. Notice that the proportion of un-compromised devices increasingly drops from 100% to 0% as the malware is allowed to propagate in the network. However, when the patching process is started in the second phase (ie, t = 104), the bot-free population sharply rises until it reaches the target threshold. Although the population keeps fluctuating due to the ongoing dynamical processes but on average the policy is observed to accurately achieve the defined targets. To further illustrate the usefulness and impact of our proposed methodology and obtained results, we simulate an experiment on the actual LinkNYC hotspot locations data. We assume that IoT devices are placed at each of these locations with a communication range of 140 m Again, the simulation is carried out in two phases. In the first phase, the malware is allowed to propagate in the network until it has achieved the maximum spread. To ensure complete penetration of the malware in the network, we initially introduce the malware in nodes which have a degree of 2. This allows the propagation of the malware from one device to another over time until it affects most of the nodes during the first phase. Note that this network is not exactly a PPP, the malware spread is not as effective since some nodes may be isolated or clustered together. Similarly, during the second phase (ie, t = \\u0001\\u0002 \\u00d7 104), the patching process is started until the equilibrium is achieved. Again, the experiment is repeated for different target thresholds for bot-free population, ie, \\u03c4B = \\u0001\\u0002,\\u0001\\u0002 and \\u0001\\u0002. The snapshots of the network states at equilibrium are shown in Figure\\u00a09. A similar behaviour is observed as the network increasingly becomes bot free at equilibrium as the patching rates are increased. The time evolution of un-compromised devices for each of the thresholds is recorded in Figure\\u00a010. We start off with infecting around 40% of the devices with malware and allow it to spread. It results in an infection of around 92% of the network with 8% un-compromised devices. However, once the patching policy is implemented, the network recovers sharply and is able to achieve much higher bot-free proportions than the target. It is pertinent to mention that since the network is not a PPP, the spread of malware is more difficult. Hence, the developed patching policy is more effective than expected, resulting in better performance of the policy. Therefore, a Poisson network assumption proves to be a more conservative approximation of the real network, which is favourable in practice as the results correspond to a worst case scenario.\",\n","        \"VI. Conclusion & Future Work\",\n","        \"In this paper, we develop a mathematical model to study the formation of botnets in wireless IoT networks. A customized dynamic population process model coupled with a Poisson point process based network model is proposed to capture the evolution of different types of population in the network while keeping the network geometry into account. The proposed model characterizes the behaviour of malware transmission from one device to another using the wireless interface along with the propagation of control commands between bot devices in the network. A network defender is assumed to patch the devices to avert the formation of a botnet that may trigger a coordinated attack at a later stage. The equilibrium state of malware infection and message propagation in the devices is determined using approximate analysis. The results are then used to develop a network defense problem that aims to obtain optimal patching rates while minimizing the disruption to regular network operation under tolerable botnet activity. While the optimal patching problem may be non-convex, a dual decomposition algorithm with appropriate conditions is proposed to solve the optimization problem resulting in the optimal patching schedule for network devices based on their connectivity profile.\",\n","        \"In this work, the network defender\\u2019s problem has been studied based on the knowledge of the attacker behavior and strategies.

However, the upper bound obtained from (10) is higher, thus becoming the effective upper bound. Therefore, any \\u03bck higher than the upper bound is futile in having an impact on the equilibrium state of the devices.

Hence, the constraint\\u00a0(22) will always be satisfied if \\u03c4B is sufficiently high and therefore, we can effectively remove it from the optimization problem. This phenomenon can also be observed from Figure\\u00a012 where the equilibrium population of informed bots diminishes to zero much earlier than the equilibrium proportion of un-compromised devices.\",\n","        \"To prove that the duality gap for the optimization problem formulated in\\u00a0eqs.\\u00a0(20) to\\u00a0(22) is zero, we invoke a key result from\\u00a040. An adaptation of its statement is provided as follows: Consider the primal optimization problem of the form minimize\\u00a0\\u2211 k=1kmaxfk(xk) subject to \\u2211k=1kmaxhk(xk) \\u2264P, where fk(.) is a scalar function, hk(.) is a vector function, and P is a vector of constraints. Both fk(.) and hk(.) may not necessarily be convex. Now, let x and y be the optimal solutions to be problem with P = Px and P = Py respectively. Then, for \\u03bd \\u2208 [0,1], if there exists z such that \\u2211 k=1kmaxhk(zk) \\u2264 \\u03bdPx + (1 \\u2212 \\u03bd)Py and \\u2211 k=1kmaxfk(zk) \\u2264 \\u03bd \\u2211k=1kmaxfk(xk) + (1 \\u2212 \\u03bd)\\u2211k=1kmaxfk(yk), then the duality gap is zero leading to the same solution for the primal and dual problems. For more details, the readers are referred to\\u00a040 and references therein. Now, for the problem considered in this paper, the objective is strictly convex while the constraints may not necessarily be convex. Assuming that we are considering the feasible regime for \\u03bc as defined in Corollary\\u00a01 and \\u03bcx, \\u03bcy are the optimal patching rates corresponding to threshold vectors Px and Py. First, assume that only the constraint\\u00a0(21) is active, ie, Px = \\u03c4Bx and Py = \\u03c4By are scalars. Since Bk\\u2217(.) is strictly monotone, so if \\u03c4Bx > \\u03c4By, then the optimal \\u03bcx,k > \\u03bcy,k,\\u00a0\\u2200k Therefore, there exists an interior point \\u03bcz = {\\u03bcz,k : min(\\u03bcx,k,\\u03bcy,k) \\u2264 zk \\u2264 max(\\u03bcx,k,\\u03bcy,k),\\u00a0\\u2200k} for which \\u2212\\u2211 k=1kmaxBk\\u2217(\\u03bcz,k) \\u2264\\u2212\\u03bd\\u03c4Bx \\u2212 (1 \\u2212 \\u03bd)\\u03c4By. From the convexity of \\u03d5k(.) in the objective in\\u00a0(20), it is clear that \\u2211 k=1kmax\\u03d5k(\\u03bcz,k)\\u03c0k \\u2264 \\u03bd \\u2211k=1kmax\\u03d5k(\\u03bcx,k)\\u03c0k + (1 \\u2212 \\u03bd)\\u2211k=1kmax\\u03d5k(\\u03bcy,k)\\u03c0k. This implies that the duality gap of the problem is zero. Now, when both constraints\\u00a0(22) and\\u00a0(21) are active, the argument still applies since both \\u2212Bk\\u2217(.) and BIk\\u2217 are strictly decreasing functions of the arguments which guarantees the existence of an interior point corresponding to every linear combination of Px and Py The convexity of the objective function subsequently completes the proof.\",\n","        \"Muhammed Junaid Farooq\",\n","        \"Arabia, in 2013 and 2015, respectively.
